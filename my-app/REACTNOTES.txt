When making a .js component you have to use the export method to call for the componenet ot js module to do this we can use two ways
    1. using default exports default function addTwo(a, b) {
        console.log(a + b)
}

    2. You can close any function after the ( {} ) function
        function ex {
        yada dada baba
}
    export default ex

When we want to import our functions to our index.html we need to
    example: at top of the page and this works with pages and other components
        TOP PAGE | import { ex } from "./ex"

Components are parts of what makes the complete UI puzzle, for an example one Component can work for the nav bar, while another component creates
the header bellow on your home page.
